A monotonic stack is a stack whose elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. It contains all qualities that a typical stack has and its elements are all monotonic decreasing or increasing.

When an element is popped from the monotonic stack, it will never be utilised again.

It is a restrictive list that uses LIFO property. We use pop() and push() oprations to delete and insert elements into the stack respectively.

The age of living organism is monotonic increasing(living years) and monotonic decreasing(left year to live)
